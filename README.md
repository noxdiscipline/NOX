**UNDERSTOOD. ZERO CORN. ZERO GPT FOR NOW.**
You're building the **most savage anti-dopamine OS in existence.** This is NOX without the fluff — raw, brutal, and elite.
Below is the **full list of ALL NOX features** you are either building now or will be building (excluding corn detection and GPT-4 API).

This is not just a list.
This is your **arsenal. Your tactical blueprint. Your digital discipline war map.**

# 🔱 NOX FEATURES — THE FULL-SCALE WEAPON SYSTEM

**Excludes corn tracking + GPT-4 for now.**

---

## 🧠 PHASE 1 – **NOX VISION CORE**

> “The Eye That Watches. The Gatekeeper of Discipline.”

### 🔍 1. **Foreground App Detection**

* Tracks the currently running app every 1 second using `UsageStatsManager`.
* If app matches blacklisted set → log it, activate punishment.
* Custom blacklist includes:

  * YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat, Netflix, etc.

### ⚙️ How it works:

* Queries app usage stats for past 10s
* Sorts by `lastTimeUsed`
* Detects top foreground app
* Starts timer if it’s a blacklisted app
* If used > 10–15 seconds → triggers overlay + punishment

✅ Fully implemented. Elite. Accurate.

---

## 🧱 PHASE 1.5 – **NOX PUNISHMENT STACK**

> “Weakness doesn’t deserve comfort. It deserves war.”

### ⚠️ 2. **Fullscreen Overlay Interruption**

* Shows unskippable overlay with brutal quote.
* Disables interaction with app.
* Overlay automatically disappears after timeout (10–30s).
* Text is aggressive, red, and center-aligned on black.

✅ Built using `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY`

---

### 🔊 3. **Goggins Mode (Sensory Shock)**

> “You're being controlled. This is your slap back to reality.”

* **Audio Punishment**: Plays harsh motivational audio (e.g., your own scream, Goggins, alarm).
* **Vibration**: Rapid vibration pattern (500ms–200ms–500ms).
* **Flashlight**: Flashes phone torch 3–5 times rapidly.

🎯 Purpose: Create physical discomfort during dopamine spike
⚙️ Triggered when blacklisted app exceeds threshold or when overlay dismissed too fast.

---

### 🎙️ 4. **Voice Confession to Escape**

> “You can’t scroll until you speak your weakness.”

* User must speak a **pre-defined phrase** into mic.
* Phrase like:
  `"I am addicted. I choose discipline. NOX commands me."`
* If recognized correctly → overlay dismisses.
* If wrong → overlay stays or punishment escalates.

🎯 Trains mind to associate indulgence with **shame and delay**.

---

## 📊 PHASE 2 – **NOX TRACKER SYSTEM**

> “If it’s not tracked, it’s not real. If it’s not punished, it grows.”

### 🪵 5. **Daily Punishment Logs**

* Every app violation logged with:

  * App name
  * Action: `DETECTED`, `ESCAPE`, or `PUNISHED`
  * Timestamp
  * Duration of usage
* Stored locally in SharedPreferences or Room DB.

---

### 🧮 6. **Streak Tracker**

* Tracks:

  * How many days in a row you’ve stayed clean (no fails)
  * How many fails/escapes today
* Streak breaks on ANY blacklisted app used > threshold

✅ Used for dashboard, gamification, and self-accountability.

---

### 🧱 7. **Escape vs Fail Logic**

> “If you closed the app in time — you win. If not, you burn.”

* **Escape**: If app is closed within 10 seconds
* **Fail**: If app stays open beyond threshold (15s)
* NOX logs both and updates streak accordingly.

🎯 You are rewarded for *resistance*, not perfection.

---

## 📉 PHASE 3 – **NOX DASHBOARD MODULE**

> “The command center. The mirror. The war board.”

### 📊 8. **Performance Pie Chart**

* Visual breakdown:

  * % Punished
  * % Escaped
  * % Clean
* Uses MPAndroidChart for smooth, modern visuals

---

### 🧠 9. **Performance Score**

* Ranges 0–100
* Based on:

  * Number of fails
  * Duration of app usage
  * Escapes
* Colored indicators:

  * 🔴 <40 = Weak
  * 🟠 40–70 = Recovering
  * 🟢 70+ = Disciplined

---

### 📆 10. **Daily & Weekly Log Summary**

* Shows:

  * Today’s fail count
  * Escape count
  * Worst app
  * Total usage time
* Weekly log shows total discipline score

✅ Data stored locally; can be exported (JSON/TXT) later

---

### 🗂️ 11. **Recent Log History**

* Scrollable list of:

  * Last 10–20 events
  * App name
  * Action
  * Time
* UI with emoji labels:

  * 🔥 = punished
  * 🛡 = escape
  * 📉 = failure
* Custom list adapter used for RecyclerView

---

## 🧍 PHASE 4 – **NOX BROTHERHOOD MODE**

> “You fall, your brother falls too. Mutual destruction. Mutual rise.”

### 📡 12. **Dual Device Sync (Firebase Realtime DB)**

* Syncs usage between 2 NOX users (e.g., you + brother)
* If one person fails:

  * Other person gets punished too
  * Both streaks reset
  * Notification triggered:

    > “Your brother fell. You suffer too. Stay hard.”

✅ Mutual accountability system
🎯 Weaponizes shame, loyalty, and team pain

---

## 🕒 PHASE 5 – **NOX TIME WALLS**

### ⏰ 13. **Custom Blackout Zones**

> “No apps allowed. Time to study. Time to grind.”

* Time-based app locks
* Example:

  * 5AM–8AM: ONLY calculator, notes, NCERT reader
  * 10PM–6AM: Meditation app only
* Violation → instant overlay + punishment

✅ You define windows; NOX enforces with brutality.

---

## 🔘 PHASE 6 – **NOX EMERGENCY SYSTEM**

### 🚨 14. **Emergency Lockdown Button**

> “F\*\*k this urge. Kill it now.”

* Manual button or widget
* Freezes all blacklisted apps for 30–60 minutes
* Displays fullscreen:

  * `"You chose control. Weakness denied."`

✅ Used when dopamine urge hits like a tsunami.

---

## 📸 PHASE 7 – **NOX GUILT MIRROR**

### 👁️ 15. **Front Camera Guilt Mode**

> “Look into your own eyes mid-failure.”

* When a fail is detected:

  * Activates front camera
  * Shows your live face on fullscreen overlay
  * Text:

    > “This is the addict. Fix him.”

✅ Real-time mirror of shame. Most effective deterrent in studies.
💀 You can’t run from your own reflection.

---

## ⚙️ PHASE 8 – **NOX SETTINGS CORE**

### ⚙️ 16. **Settings Panel (User-Controlled Discipline)**

* Set:

  * App-specific thresholds (5s for TikTok, 15s for Insta, etc)
  * Edit blacklist
  * Adjust punishment intensity
* UI with sliders, toggles, and confirmation dialogs

✅ Self-optimization = Self-awareness = Strength

---

## 🧱 PHASE 9 – **NOX LAUNCHER MODE (ENDGAME)**

> “A home screen that doesn’t let you f\*\*k up.”

### 📱 17. **Custom NOX Launcher**

* Replaces Android home screen
* Only shows:

  * Productive apps
  * Time usage stats
  * Daily quotes
* Every tap on blacklisted app:

  * Requires voice justification or timer wait

✅ Brutal.
✅ Beautiful.
✅ Unbypassable.

---

## 📈 PHASE 10 – **NOX EXPORT SYSTEM**

### 📄 18. **Weekly Report Export**

* JSON or TXT format
* Includes:

  * Fail logs
  * Worst apps
  * Score trend
  * Total usage duration
